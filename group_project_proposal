Introduction
Tennis is a highly competitive sport with many professionals starting at a young age. Furthermore, it is notorious for having an early retirement age compared to other sports. Many professional tennis player retire before 30, but popular players have retired at a much later age. With such an emphasis on age and success, our project aims to answer if age predicts success among the Top 500 tennis players. Using the "Player Stats for Top 500 Players" data set from https://www.ultimatetennisstatistics.com, the team selected only the age, current rank, current elo rank, and prize money (total accumulated earnings) variables from the .csv file.

We have chosen to assess a player's current rank as opposed to their best rank in order to reflect their current age in the ranking decision. Furthermore, Rank refers to an accumulation of points scored by a player across various different tournaments while Elo Rank is a comparative ranking that gauges a player's skill against their opponents. For example, a player who competes in lower-level tournaments may have a high rank but not necessarily a high elo rank. Looking at both ranking systems can help us determine the skill and ultimate success of a player.


Methods
We first cleaned and wrangled the variables into a tidydata format. We then split the data into training and testing sets. We then visualized variables of the training set by creating three individual scatter plots with age on the x-axis and the current rank, current elo rank, or prize money on the y-axis respectively. 


Afterwards, we will use KNN regression to see if age can predict values of current rank, current elo rank, and prize money. We will achieve this by using the training data set to run a cross-validation to choose the best K parameter, and train and fit the model. Then, we will use the testing data set to evaluate our model's performance. We will then visualize the results by creating six individual graphs (three histograms and three scatter plots) of the original data set, all with a trend line representing our model's regression predictions, and age on the x-axis and the current rank, current elo rank, or prize money each on the y-axis. The histogram will have bins distributed by age group. 

Expected Outcomes and Significance
We expect to find that players in their early to mid-twenties will have a higher current rank and current elo rank while players of an older age will have higher prize money. Tennis players could use this data to assess their  earnings at any given age and better plan for their career's future.

Further research might include how other variables in the same data set (such as height and number of years gone professional) as well as other possible variables outside this data set (such as number of years spent training or costs spent on training) change the relationship between age and success.
