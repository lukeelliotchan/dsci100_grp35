Introduction
Tennis, despite being a widely popular recreational sport, is known for having --. 
Our project aims to answer the question: does age predict success in the Top 500 tennis players. We are using the Player Stats for Top 500 Players data set from https://www.ultimatetennisstatistics.com. The data set is a .csv file containing several different types of information about each player but for this question, we will be focusing on the variables age, current rank, current elo rank, and prize money (total earnings throughout their career). In considering rank, we decided to use current rank as opposed to best rank because best rank is not recorded at the same time that the age of the player was recorded for this data set, which make it not dependent on age. 

 

First, we will clean and wrangle the data to summarize the variables of interest into a single tabular data set. Then, we will visualize the data by creating three individual scatter plots with age on the x-axis and the current rank, current elo rank, or prize money each on the y-axis. After, we will use regression to see if age can predict values of current rank, current elo rank, and prize money by first splitting the data set into training and testing data sets. Then, we will use cross-validation to choose the best parameters for the model, then create a recipe, specify the model, then fit the model onto the training data. We will then evaluate the performance of our regression model on the testing data set.

We expect to find that players of a younger age will have a higher current rank and current elo rank. We also predict that players of older age will have higher prize money (total earnings throughout their career). These findings could help contribute to tennis players' decisions for when to retire since they may be able to predict at what age their rankings might decrease and what their total earnings would be by that age, allowing them to better plan their career. Future questions from this project could include how the other variables in this same data set such as height and number of years gone professional, as well as other possible variables outside this data set such as number of years spent training or how much money spent for training, mediate the relationship between age and success.
